The options under Main menu -> Settings -> Themes options should be limited to only default, icedesert, nice, nice2, win95, and yellowmotif.

The win95 theme should be already implemented.

The main menu of the live CD should include a "Swift Linux Installer" option.  This option should NOT be available after Swift Linux is freshly installed on a hard drive.

Make sure that the Help section of the main menu does not include links to deleted applications (such as Fluxbox)
